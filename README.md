# DigitClassifier---Neural-Network-Project
This project takes dataset from MNIST which contains (28 x 28) pixel images of 0-9 digits. I have trained a model which is an improvement of output softmax activation function. All the implemented layers are dense. Neural network contains 3 layers with 128,128 and 10 neurons respectively
